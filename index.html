<h1>hello! :-)</h1>
<p>I am a computer science student at Harvard driven by wanting to learn as much about the world as I can, and I share my perspective on those things through art, technology, and education.
  I am most excited by the intersections between fields and applications of academia to everyday life.</p>
<p>When I'm not studying or working on a project, you can find me doodling in a park, playing tunes on the piano, singing <em>Hamilton</em>, or playing Tetris.
  Being from Southern California, I'm unsurprisingly a big fan of beach sunsets, fresh fruit, and Asian foods.
  I tend to stay pretty busy - look <a href="{{ site.url }}/about">here</a> to read about things I have done.</p>
