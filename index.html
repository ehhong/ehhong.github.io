<h1>hello! :-)</h1>
<p>My name is Emily Hong, and I'm a computer science student at Harvard College. I love art & design, math & computer science, and education.</p>
<p>When I'm not studying, you can find me doodling in a park, playing tunes on the piano, singing (almost) all the parts in Hamilton, or playing tetris.
  Being from Southern California (west coast best coast), I'm unsurprisingly a big fan of beach sunsets, fresh fruit, and Asian foods.
  I tend to stay pretty busy - look <a href="{{ site.url }}/about">here</a> to read about things I have done.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by, and best of luck with wherever you are going!</p>
