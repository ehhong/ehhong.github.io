#   description: Over the fall of 2018, I collected interviews from 15 members of the Harvard Asian American community. Hoping to counteract the lack of Asian American stories in the media, I compiled and illustrated their stories to share how they see themselves.

  description: Chinatown Afterschool Program (CHAP) is the only free after school program in Boston's Chinatown, serving 60+ elementary school students with a team of 90+ counselors. I was a counselor from 2017-2022 and served as co-director of CHAP from 2020-2021. During my director term, I transitioned the program online during a pandemic, managed parent communication, re-vamped branding and recruiting efforts, and coordinated day-to-day logistics.
